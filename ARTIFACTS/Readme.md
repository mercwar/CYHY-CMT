## AVIS CYHY COMMENT BLOCK

# 🚀 Overview

The **AVIS Snapshot Engine** is a **forensic-grade file identity and snapshot management system** designed for advanced development environments.

It provides a structured mechanism to:

* identify files with **globally unique artifact metadata**
* capture **version snapshots**
* restore historical file states
* track **artifact lineage**
* support **AI-assisted development workflows**

The system is intended for use inside the **AVIS Core Architecture**, where each source artifact can **self-describe its identity, project context, and disk location**.

The engine functions as the **temporal memory layer** of the AVIS ecosystem.

---

# 🧠 Core Concepts

## Artifact Identity

Every file in the AVIS system can contain a structured identity record.

This identity records:

* disk location
* project ownership
* build environment
* module classification
* artifact GUID
* security metadata

This allows tools to determine:

```
disk → project → module → artifact
```

---

## Snapshot Engine

The Snapshot Engine creates binary `.FVS` snapshot files that store:

* file identity
* timestamp
* integrity hash
* source data

Snapshots allow developers to:

* restore previous versions
* analyze historical file states
* perform forensic artifact tracing

# ⚙️ Components

## Identity System

Defines the full **metadata identity of a source artifact**.

Includes:

* disk information
* project ownership
* file fingerprint
* build environment
* security configuration

Main structure:

```
AVIS_ArtifactIdentity
```

---

## Snapshot System

Handles binary snapshot files using the `.FVS` format.

Capabilities:

* snapshot creation
* snapshot restore
* snapshot inspection
* snapshot integrity verification

Main structure:

```
AVIS_SnapshotHeader
```

---

## Security Layer

Provides verification utilities including:

* GUID generation
* SHA-256 hashing
* integrity validation

These protect against:

* corrupted snapshots
* identity spoofing
* data tampering

---

# 📦 Snapshot File Format (.FVS)

```
+---------------------------+
| MAGIC ID ("FVS1")         |
| SNAPSHOT GUID             |
| TIMESTAMP                 |
| FILE HASH (SHA256)        |
| FILE SIZE                 |
| DELTA OFFSET              |
| FILE DATA                 |
+---------------------------+
```

This binary structure allows extremely fast snapshot storage and restoration.

# 🛠️ Build Instructions

Compile using a standard C compiler.

Example using **GCC**:

```
gcc -Iinclude src/*.c examples/identity_demo.c -o avis_demo
```

Example using **Clang**:

```
clang -Iinclude src/*.c examples/identity_demo.c -o avis_demo
```

Recommended flags:

```
-O2
-Wall
-fno-strict-aliasing
-fstack-protector
```

---

# ▶️ Running the Example

```
./avis_demo
```

Example output:

```
[AVIS] File Identity Report

File Name        : AVIS-FVS-SNAPSHOT.c
Project          : AVIS CORE
Path             : B:\AVIS\ENGINE\FVS\AVIS-FVS-SNAPSHOT.c
```

---

# 🔐 Security Model

The AVIS engine performs integrity verification using:

* SHA-256 hashing
* GUID validation
* metadata verification
* path normalization

Failure modes include:

```
HASH_MISMATCH
SNAPSHOT_NOT_FOUND
CORRUPT_METADATA
DISK_WRITE_FAILURE
```

---

# 🧩 Integration

The AVIS Snapshot Engine can integrate with:

* automated build pipelines
* AI code generators
* artifact scanners
* development tooling
* forensic code analysis systems

It is particularly effective in environments where **code is generated or modified by AI agents**.

---

# 🌐 Intended Use Cases

The system is ideal for:

* AI-assisted software development
* forensic code tracking
* artifact lineage tracking
* large codebase maintenance
* automated development pipelines

# ⚡ Future Development

Planned improvements include:

* delta snapshot compression
* project-wide artifact registry
* Git-style snapshot diffing
* automated project scanning
* identity embedding inside compiled binaries

# 🧠 Philosophy

```
The Engine Persists.
Artifacts Evolve.
Snapshots Preserve Memory.
