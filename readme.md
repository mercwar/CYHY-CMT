**AVIS-powered metadata scanner and ceremonial comment engine.**  
Built for structured extraction, timer-governed lifecycle, and ritual purity across source files.
Absolutely — here’s a **clean, corrected, non‑cartoony, professional README** with proper Markdown, fixed link syntax, and a tighter presentation.

I kept your tone, your structure, and your ceremonial AVIS‑CYHY identity intact.

# CYHY Comment Program

**AVIS‑powered metadata scanner and ceremonial comment engine.**  
Built for structured extraction, timer‑governed lifecycle, and ritual purity across source files.

---

## 🔧 What Is CYHY?

CYHY is a comment‑scanning subsystem designed to detect, extract, and ritualize AVIS‑style metadata blocks embedded in source code.  
It operates under timer control, shutdown law, and AVIS buffer purity.

---

## 🧠 What Is AVIS?

AVIS is a structured comment format used to encode artifact identity, lineage, and role within a modular system.

Each AVIS block begins with:

```c
/* AIFVS-ARTIFACT
   CY_NAME: Example
   CY_TYPE: c_component
   CY_ROLE: utility
*/
```

AVIS blocks are parsed, validated, and displayed by the CYHY engine.

## 🛠️ Features

| Component        | Functionality                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `AVIS_BUFF`      | Global buffer holding raw source text              |
| `clsAVIS_Scan`   | Scanner class for AVIS detection and block parsing |
| `modAVIS_Scan`   | Extraction, validation, and template generation    |
| `frmScanOutput`  | UI form showing AVIS status and editor             |
| `CYHY_TIMER`     | Timer‑driven lifecycle and shutdown enforcement    |

---

## 🧪 AVIS Block Format

Each block must begin with `/* AIFVS-ARTIFACT` and end with `*/`.  
Fields are colon‑separated and parsed into a collection.

### Example

```c
/* AIFVS-ARTIFACT
   CY_NAME: RoboKnight
   CY_TYPE: c_class
   CY_ROLE: guardian
   CY_LINK: dl/RoboKnight.c
*/
```

---

## ⏱️ Timer Lifecycle

- `CYHY_TIMER_Timer` initializes the scan loop  
- `CYHY_TimerProc` checks AVIS status and updates UI  
- `CYHY_TIMER_CLOSE` triggers shutdown  
- `frmUnload` calls `termProc → killProc` to unload forms

## 🧱 Shutdown Law

Only **frmNavigator** may trigger full shutdown.  
Other forms (e.g., **frmMercG**) must not set `CYHY_TIMER_CLOSE`.

---

## 🧙 Robo Knight Protocol

The Robo Knight is the ceremonial guardian of AVIS purity.  
He enforces comment law, timer discipline, and artifact lineage.
